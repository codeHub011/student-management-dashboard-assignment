📊 Student Management Dashboard

Small institutes often require simple internal tools to manage student data effectively, but many lack technical infrastructure.
This project aims to solve that problem by providing a lightweight, web-based Student Management Dashboard.

🎯 Objective

Build a simple dashboard that allows administrators to:
Add student records
View student records
Update student records
Delete student records
All data is stored in localStorage to ensure persistence even after page refresh.

⚙️ Features

✅ CRUD Operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
✅ Data stored in localStorage (No external DB required)
✅ Responsive Table View to display records
✅ Search & Filter Option (optional but implemented for usability)

✅ Student Fields:
Name
Registration Number
Department
Year
Marks
